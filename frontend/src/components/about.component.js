Because the URL is so lengthy, it's likely that it's a URL Lengthener. This was created as a fun opportunity to educate how and when to use MERN stack.<br /><br />

The design was carefully planned, with each component having its very own particular considerations. There is an input component, a display component, a storage component, and so on. component is the only component directory having states, and it does not render anything. Instead, it sends information from applications and other child components via props.<br /><br />

Instead of implementing a web Mvc architecture with strict rules, this was an interesting solution.We have to construct each component separately. Although the fundamental concept is simple, it provides a number of significant advantages such as automatically created React components, stateless functional components, and asynchronous server calls. As a result, We are familiar with every line of code in the application.(except for node_modules of course!).<br /><br /></p>
